# rust-in-30-hours
Go from 0 to hero in rust (hopefully!)

### Format
* **Each file** is a result of a comprehensive hour-long reading of the docs which is then **distilled down to core concepts**. 
* This is **aimed at people who are coming from another programming language**. The files focus more on things that are different in rust coming from other languages instead of focusing on the repetitive basic concepts.

More Details coming soon...
