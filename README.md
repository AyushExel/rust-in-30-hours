# rust-in-30-hours
Go from 0 to hero in rust (hopefully!)

### Format
Each file is a result of a comprehensive hour-long reading of the docs which is then distilled down to core concepts. This is aimed at people who are coming from another programming language. The files focus more on things that are different in rust coming from other languages instead of focusing on the repetitive basic concepts.

More Details coming soon...
